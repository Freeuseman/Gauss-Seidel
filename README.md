Iterative technique of solving a system of linear equations

This was a college assignment where we applied iterative methods for approximating the solution of a system of n linear equations in n variables. The specification instructed the program must be able to perform the following tasks:

1. Read data from an input file containing A and b. 
2. Solve Ax = b using Sparse-SOR algorithm and the sparse matrix data structure for SOR. 

3. Write the computed solution vector x, together with the stopping reason, to an output file.
